The author's early experience as a tinkerer, pulling apart computers to understand their makeup, built an aptitude and deep understanding of how they function. This habit evolved into tinkering with software and operating systems, which often led to breaking his own PCs, forcing him to learn how to diagnose and fix issues. Subsequently, implementing tweaks on friends' and family's computers, and then having to quickly and effectively repair problems, directly led to him doing IT support for a living.

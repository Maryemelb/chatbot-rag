The author's early experience as a tinkerer involved pulling apart computers to understand their internal workings, which inevitably led to an aptitude with computers and an understanding of how they function. This continued into his twenties as he tinkered with software and operating systems, often breaking his own and later friends' and family's PCs, which forced him to learn how to diagnose and fix issues quickly and effectively. This necessity to efficiently repair problems for others directly led him to begin doing IT support for a living, initially independently and then for Fujitsu Siemens in a call center.
